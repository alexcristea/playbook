# Time Management

## Spare Capacity

Block a couple of time slots in your daily schedule to create space for unplanned events.

> I keep my 17:00 to 17:50 slot available for non-project related events.

## Plan for the Pomodoro ahead

When starting a new Pomodoro, ask yourself this question:

> What work can I do in the next 25min to extract the most value out of it?
