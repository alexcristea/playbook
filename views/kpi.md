# KPI (Key Performance Indicator)

A tool to track how a key area of the business is performing.

It consists of:

- Metric
- Target value
- Title _(should contain the metric and the target value)_

> cNPS is greater or equal to 9

## Why

It's a health metric: a high-level metric that shows how an area of an organization is performing.

They become business as usual, the daily process that helps maintain the status quo. When a KPI becomes red, you should look for points to improve in our day-by-day activities and process. You can and should make use of other metrics to get into more details.

One way you can view it is as something that indicates when something may be wrong. Like when you take your baby to her monthly checkup, and her weight is off the growth percentile graph. Most surely the pediatrician will recommend further investigation to see if there is a problem or your baby just ate too much milk.

## How

1. Decide what you want to measure

Select a maximum of 6 KPIs that important for your team and your stakeholders, and are aligned to the business priorities.

Different KPIs can serve different roles, but there must be a balance: What gives you the right view?:

- Low-level engineering can have more focuses KPIs
- Product can have user-facing KPIs
- High-level can set more business-related KPIs

2. Choose a timeframe

Typically, that would be a quarter, but you can also have long-lived KPIs. At the end of every quarter check if the KPIs should change.

3. Set up the initial mark

This can be a bit harder, especially when you just start tracking it. One approach would be to research the industry standard for that KPI. Otherwise, set a target value that you strive for and at the end of the quarter review and update it based on the gap:

- if it's worse than expected, add a KR to improve it
- if it's better than expected, rise the target value

4. Update the information as it happens.
