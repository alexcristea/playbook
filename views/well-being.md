# Well-being

## Perceived Happiness (aka P.E.R.M.A)

- Positive Emotions
    - about the past by cultivating gratefulness and forgiveness
    - about the present by savoring mindfulness and pleasure
    - about future by building hope and optimism 
- Engagement
    - in work and at home
    - fully use the skills, strengths, and attention for a challenging task or activity 
        - this creates an experience called _flow_
        - it is more gratifying than the outcome
- Positive Relationships
    - Connection to others
    - It brings joy, laughter, meaning and purpose, a sense of belonging, and pride in accomplishment

    - It can be spiritual or existential (family, science, social cause, politics, work, etc)
- Accomplishment
    - Achievement and mastery for its own sake
