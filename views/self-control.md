### Self-control (or self-regulation)

> _To ragulate_: to guide towards a specific goal or standard.

Self-control is the ability to regulate emotions, thoughts, and behavior in the face of temptation and impulses (aka short term goals) and act on long term goals. It consumes willpower.

It is the trait of positive outcomes in life, but also the root cause of all personal and social problems.

The brain area that is responsible for self-control is called **anterior cingulate cortex**: it watches for conflicts in what you are doing and what you intended to do.

However, depleting willpower shift the activity from one part of the brain to another, thus:

- the level of energy consumption remains the same
- this justifies why we have an increase in the intensity of our feelings (and craving for sweets)

### Emotion control

Trying to escape from bad moods or unpleasant thoughts. Sometimes to avoid cheeriness.

It is hard to control because you cannot alter your mood by an act of will.

I try to name the emotion to get it out of my mind. It usually works after I find the source of the emotion.

Also, trying to distract yourself with other thoughts or activities also helps.

### Thought control

Trying to ignore something serious or something annoying, like an earworm.

Meditation and focus help. I try to put my thoughts on the paper and this works for me most of the time.

Often, we seek a predetermined conclusion (like principles, values, common believes or just deceiving ourselves)

### Impulse control

Ability to resist temptation like alcohol, smoking, sweets, etc.

However, we cannot control impulses. We can only control how we react to them.

### Performance control

Focusing the energy on the task at hand: balanced between speed, accuracy. time management or persevering when you feel like quitting.

## Ego depletion

_Ego depletion_: diminish the capacity to self-control by overexerting willpower. Studies show that ego depletion can affect other social animals (like dogs).

Symptoms: Look for a change in the overall intensity of your feeling. Craving for sweets.

## Mastering self-control

Mastering self-control enables you to conserve willpower for more important challenges.

### How to master self-control:

1. Set a goal

The problem is that we have too many goals, and some of them are even conflicting.

Conflicting goals:

- you worry a lot: as you spend more time thinking
- you get less done: as you spend more time ruminating then taking action
- your mental and physical health suffers: you become stuck and more unhappy and unhealthy

Short vs. long term goals:

- _short term goals_ help you focus, be productive, and performant.
- _long term goals_ help you adjust your short term goals into the right direction

OKR is a framework that seems to be built around this idea: Objective with Key Results and weekly initiatives.

Also, SMART Objectives and WOOP are similar systems.

Fuzzy vs. fussy (daily vs monthly planning):

- _monthly planning_ gives flexibility.
- _daily planning_ is rigid, time-consuming and creates frustrations if it doesn't happen

There should be an equilibrium between long term and short term planning

> _Tip_: Create a list of priorities. Drop all items after the 3rd one.

Use the GTD system.
