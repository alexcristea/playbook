# Anticipatory-anxiety

A characteristic of a fear that produces exactly what you're afraid of.

> For example, if you're afraid that you'll sweat when you'll have to speak in public again, this fear will make you even more prone to sweat when you do the speaking.

## Hyper-intention

As opposed to anticipatory-anxiety, hyper-intention is a forced intention that seems impossible to fulfill.

> For example, achieving happiness (or pleasure or success) will never happen if it's a goal in itself. It should be a side-effect.

## Hyper-reflection

In addition to hyper-intention, hyper-reflection happens when you put more focus on yourself rather than on your goals, making these goals feel impossible to fulfill.

> For example, you won't publish that article if you're concerned with what people think about you're writing skills.

## Paradoxical intention

Paradoxical intention suggests that, to overcome a fear, you should intent what you are afraid of.

> For example, when you can't fall asleep change your intention to stay awake as much as you can (but without leaving your bed).
