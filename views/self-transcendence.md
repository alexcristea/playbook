# Self-transcendence

It refers to the fact that being human always points to something, or someone, other than oneself — be it a meaning to fulfill or another person to experience.

_Self-actualization_ is possible only as a side-effect of _self-transcendence_.

> The more one forgets himself, by giving himself to a cause to serve or another person to love, the more human he is and the more he actualizes himself.
