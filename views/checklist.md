# Checklist

> Checklists ... establish a higher standard of baseline performance.

The quick and simple tool to:

- make explicit the minimum required steps for protection against the ineptitude errors.
- get the stupid stuff right and to leave room for the craft and judgment and ability to respond to unexpected difficulties.
- support the skills of expert professionals.
- create the discipline of higher performance.

From the engineering point of view, a checklist is a _forcing function_: relatively straightforward solutions that force the necessary behavior.

### What they're not

Checklists are not comprehensive how-to guides.

## Science

1. Define clear pause points

- When the checklist is supposed to be used
- Unless the moment is obvious (e.g. warning light)

2. Choose a type

- Do-Confirm or
- Read-Do

3. Make it to the point

- Choose between 5 and 9 items (the limit of working memory)
- Keep the list short
- Put only the killer items (dangerous to skip and sometimes are overlooked)

4. Use simple and compact wording

- Use the familiar language of the profession

5. Pay attention to the look

- Fit on one page
- Free of clutter
- Use typography easy to read (like Helvetica)

6. Test it in the real world

- Crate a simulator or
- Rehearse it
- Adjust until it works consistently

7. Define who is accountable for making sure the checklist is followed

- Choose someone with the least power in the process
- Give the necessary power to enforce it

Look for the patterns of mistakes and put a few checklists in place, just like a programmer will put a unit test in place for a defect he is fixing.

### Traits of a good checklist:

- Precise and to the point
- Easy to use (even in the most difficult situations)
- Offer reminders of the most important and critical steps
- Practical

## Ussage

No matter how specialized and trained we are, inaptitude errors still occur.

There are two main difficulties that experts face in the working environment:

1. The fallibility of human memory and attention (especially into routines that are overlooked or under pressure)
2. They tend to skip steps even when they know them (since some steps don't always matter)

### Routine checklists

To protect against our flaws of memory, attention, and thoroughness.

### Emergency checklists

To protect against failures that you may not encounter never, but very useful if you need them.

### Handle complexity, uncertainty, and unexpected

Make sure that the right people speak one with another, at the right time frame, and about the right aspect of the problem.

### Dispersing the power of decision and responsibility

- Create instruction for workers to cover the simple and routine problems and ensure they are not overlooked.
- Create communication and coordination instructions to cover the complex and non-routine problems.

### Help experts remember how to

- Handle a complex situation
- Configure a machine
- Make priorities clearer
- Function better within teams

Now more fields (medicine, financing, lawyers, software designing) have become more complex to rely only on memory. However, although checklists proved they work, they cannot make anybody follow them by themself.

Maybe we consider that they are too complicated to be reduced to something as simple as a checklist or maybe because it feels beneath us to use one.
