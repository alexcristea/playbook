# Mind flaws

## Anticipatory-anxiety

A characteristic of a fear that produces exactly what you're afraid of.

> For example, if you're afraid that you'll sweat when you'll have to speak in public again, this fear will make you even more prone to sweat when you do the speaking.

## Hyper-intention

As opposed to anticipatory-anxiety, hyper-intention is a forced intention that seems impossible to fulfill.

> For example, achieving happiness (or pleasure or success) will never happen if it's a goal in itself. It should be a side-effect.

## Hyper-reflection

In addition to hyper-intention, hyper-reflection happens when you put more focus on yourself rather than on your goals, making these goals feel impossible to fulfill.

> For example, you won't publish that article if you're concerned with what people think about you're writing skills.

## Paradoxical intention

Paradoxical intention suggests that, to overcome a fear, you should intent what you are afraid of.

> For example, when you can't fall asleep change your intention to stay awake as much as you can (but without leaving your bed).

## _Our Boys Didn't Die in Vain_ Syndrome

Paradoxically, the more sacrifices we make for an imaginary story, the more tenaciously we hold on to it, because we desperately want to give meaning to these sacrifices and to the suffering we have caused.

> It is much easier to live with the fantasy, because the fantasy gives meaning to the suffering.

> Our narrating self would much prefer to continue suffering in the future, just so it wonâ€™t have to admit that our past suffering was devoid of all meaning.
