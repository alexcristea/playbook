# Meaning in life

> Ultimately, man should not ask what the meaning of his life is, but rather he must recognize that it is he who is asked. In a word, each man is questioned by life; and he can only answer to life by answering for his own life; to life he can only respond by being responsible.

# Existential vacuum

The inability to find or create meaning in one's life, leading to feelings of emptiness, alienation, futility, and aimlessness.

# Finding or creating meaning

According to [Logotherapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logotherapy), you can find meaning:

- by _engaging in your work_ or by doing a deed that only you can do.
- by _experiencing a person or a thing_ in her, respectively its, uniqueness.
- by the attitude you take toward _unavoidable suffering_.

You should not try to find an abstract meaning in life, but rather you should try to find meaning in everything you do, context by context, day by day, hour by hour. The best place to look for meaning is not within you, but rather in an extrinsic cause or another person to love (aka [self-trancedence](/views/self-transcendence.md)).

When suffering is unavoidable, you can still find meaning by changing your attitude toward that suffering. This way you can turn personal tragedy into a human achievement. However, when suffering can be avoided, it's desirable to remove the root cause of the pain.

When it comes to the way we respond to life, it's important to keep in mind that between the stimulus (which is not in your control) and your reaction (which is in your control) there is a space of freedom that nobody can take it from you: the freedom to choose how you react to the stimulus. This is at the heart of the Proactivity Principal and the foundation of my [Responsibility](/me.md) value.
