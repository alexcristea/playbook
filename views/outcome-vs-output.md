## Outcome vs. Output

- **Outcome**: something what happens as a consequence or your actions.
- **Output**: your actions — tasks, your todos, a project, or the deliverables.

Start with the end in mind: the outcomes always come last. Focus on results rather than actions and track the progress of what matters.

This enables you to:

- boost performance
- learn
- protect employees against micromanagement

> - **Output**: I’ve called a prospect.
> - **Outcome**: I’ve closed a customer.
