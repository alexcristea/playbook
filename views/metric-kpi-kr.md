# Metrics vs. KPIs vs. KRs

### Metrics

A metric is a tool for measurement.

It consists of:

- Formula for measurement
- Current value

> cNPS, Cashflow, Velocity

KPIs and KRs make use a metrics but are much more than just a metric.

### KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)

A tool to track how a key area of the business is performing.

It consists of:

- Metric
- Target value
- Title _(should contain the metric and the target value)_

They become the business as usual.

> cNPS is greater or equal to 9

### KRs (Key Results)

A tool to positively impact the performance of a certain metric.

It consists of:

- Metric
- Start value
- Target value
- Title _(should contain the metric, the start value and the target value)_

A KR should belong to an objective:

- it removes the ambiguity by clarifying and quantifying what success looks like for that objective.
- measures the progress towards that objective.

An objective needs 2-3 KRs. A metaphor for this is the GPS that needs 2-3 satellites to pin point your location.

> Increase cNPS from 7 to 9
