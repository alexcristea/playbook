## Master builders

Throughout history, master builders were hired to design, engineer and oversee constructions from start to finish. They are the ones that built the Notre Dame or the United States Capitol Building.

All learned occupations have a definition of professionalism:

1. The expectation of selflessness: place the needs and concerns of those who depend on us above our own
2. The expectation of skill: we will aim for excellence in our knowledge and expertise

4. The expectation of discipline: discipline in following prudent procedures and in functioning with others

Since we are not built for discipline, discipline is something we have to work at.

> "Anyone who understands systems will know immediately that optimizing parts is not a good route to system excellence. If we connect the engine of a Ferrari, the brakes of a Porsche, the suspension of a BMW, the body of a Volvo, what we get, of course, is nothing close to a great car; we get a pile of very expensive junk."
