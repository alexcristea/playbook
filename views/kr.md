# KR (Key Result)

A tool to positively impact the performance of a certain metric.

It consists of:

- Metric
- Start value
- Target value
- Title _(should contain the metric, the start value, and the target value)_

A KR should belong to an objective:

- it removes the ambiguity by clarifying and quantifying what success looks like for that objective.
- benchmark and measure the progress towards that objective.

## Traits of effectie KRs

Pair KRs to measure both **effect** and **counter-effect** (**quantity** and **quality**).

### Less is more

- An objective needs 2-3 KRs. However, not more than 5 KRs.
- A metaphor for this is the GPS that needs 2-3 satellites to pinpoint your location.

### KRs should

- Be specific and time-bound.
- Be measurable and verifiable.
- Be ambitious yet realistic.
- Be a milestone. In the end, you should be able to say "did I do it, or not?", no arguing about it.
- Completion of all KRs means the achievement of the objective.

### Stay flexible

- KRs can be changed or even discarded if the context changes.
- KRs are not commandments set in stone.
- You may realize the right KR after starting work.
