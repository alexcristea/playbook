# KRs (Key Results)

A tool to positively impact the performance of a certain metric.

It consists of:

- Metric
- Start value
- Target value
- Title _(should contain the metric, the start value and the target value)_

A KR should belong to an objective:

- it removes the ambiguity by clarifying and quantifying what success looks like for that objective.
- measures the progress towards that objective.

An objective needs 2-3 KRs. A metaphor for this is the GPS that needs 2-3 satellites to pin point your location.
