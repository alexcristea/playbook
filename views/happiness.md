# Happiness

Happiness is a state of mind, caracterised by a positive emotional condition.

## Formula for sustainable happiness

```math
H = 0.5 * Genetics + 0.1 * Context + 0.4 * Actions
```

- Genetics
    - We get born with a generic material that dictates about 50% of our longterm sustainable happiness
    - Not in our control
- Context
    - or our environment, has only a 10% impact on our longterm happiness
        - basically where we were born, what country do we live in, is 20th century or Medieval Eve
        - how much money we make a year or what car we drive has a small impact our overall happiness
    - althoug they are not always in our control, they sometime can be influcenced
- Actions
    - everything that is in our control
        - what we think, what we belive, what we do, what we read, what we watch
        - who we spent time with, who we follow, who we work for
        - how we respond to external factor
    - they are always in our control and have a 40% impact on our sustainable happines

## Perspectives

- On a happiness scale from 0 to 10
    - Our genetic material sets out our default inteval
        - Mike may get a 2-5
        - while Shelly will get a 6-8
    - Mike won't be able to experience happiness of 8 or 9
        - however, by influence his actions and, as much as possible, his context he may increase it to 4-6
    - Meanwhile, Shelly will still be pretty happy althogh she has some negative experiences
    - On the other had, there may be some experiences (like a trauma) that can lower our interval
        - Shelly may get to 3-5 if her parents die in a car accident
- Thoughts
    - Is it possible for our actions to change the happines genetic material that we pass to our children?
