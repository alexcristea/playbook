```math
H = 0.5 * Genetics + 0.1 * Context + 0.4 * Actions
```

- Genetics
    - We get born with a generic material that dictates about 50% of our longterm sustainable happiness
    - Not in our control
- Context
    - or our environment, has only a 10% impact on our longterm happiness
        - basically where we were born, what country do we live in, is 20th century or Medieval Eve
        - how much money we make a year or what car we drive has a small impact our overall happiness
    - althoug they are not always in our control, they sometime can be influcenced
- Actions
    - everything that is in our control
        - what we think, what we belive, what we do, what we read, what we watch
        - who we spent time with, who we follow, who we work for
        - how we respond to external factor
    - they are always in our control and have a 40% impact on our sustainable happines
