# Fixed vs. growth mindset

The brain is like a muscle; the more you exercise it, the stronger it becomes. Every time you try hard and learn something new, the brain forms new connections that, over time, make you smarter.

Intellectual development is not about born intelligence, but rather forming new connections in the brain.

> "Picture your brain forming new connections as you meet the challenge and learn. Keep on going." — [Carol Dweck][author]

## Fixed mindset

The belief that intelligence is a fixed trait and you only have a certain amount.

Behavior:

- Try to look smart at all times and all costs.
- The effort is a bad thing.
- A setback or deficiency measures you and reveals your limitations.

Side effects:

- You are afraid to try things to not look dumb.
  - Care about whether people think you're smart or not.
- You seek tasks that will prove your intelligence and avoiding ones that might not.
  - Avoid tasks that might show a deficiency.
  - Avoid learning challenges if you might make mistakes.
- You think that if you have an ability you don't need effort.
  - Believe that needing to apply effort means you're dumb
- You try to hide their mistakes rather than correct them.
  - Or run of your mistakes.
- You are unable to handle difficulties, frustrations and setbacks
  - Get discouraged, give up, become defensive, acting bored, cheat, blame others.

### The role of praise:

- On intelligence: how brilliant or how talented you are.
- The message is _I value intelligence_.
- Gives the illusion that it builds confidence and motivation to learn.

> Wow, that's a very good score. You must be smart at this.

There is a false belief that praising intelligence will bust self-esteem (self-confidence) and help children enjoy learning.

## Growth mindset

The belief that intelligence can be developed through effort, dedication, learning and mentorship.

Behavior:

- Learn at all times and all costs.
- The effort is what activates your ability.
- Mistakes and setbacks are a natural part of learning.

Side effects:

- You don't think everyone is the same.
  - Understand that Einstein didn't become Einstein without the years of dedicated work.
- You're open to try things and take up challenges.
  - Care about and invest themselves in learning.
- Belive that effort is a positive thing that helps your intelligence to grow.
  - Try hard in face of frustration and failure.
  - Look for new learning strategies.

### The role of praise:

- On process: your strategy, effort, dedication, focus, persistence.
- The message is _I value process_.

> Wow, that's a very good score. You must have tried really hard.

#### Examples

> You really studied for your English test, and your improvement shows it. You read the material over several times, outlined it, and tested yourself on it. That really worked!” and “It was a long, hard assignment, but you stuck to it and got it done. You stayed at your desk, kept up your concentration, and kept working. That’s great!

> I liked the effort you put in. Let’s work together some more and figure out what you don’t understand.

> All right, that was too easy for you. Let’s do something more challenging that you can learn from.

## Open discussions

Studies show that the brain has more plasticity over time intelligence can be enhanced through learning.

> An experiment conducted on children that received different types of praise showed that the ones who received praise on their intelligence rejected the change to learn in favor of something they were sure to do well on.

It turns out that the way we praise our children has an impact on the mind-set the kids develop.

> Another study showed that the way you praise a toddler predicts her mindset 5 years later.

Convey a new value system for your children:

- Ask: _Who had a fabulous struggle today?_

Replace a failing system with not yet: you're on that learning curve somewhere:

- _I'm not good at math, yet._
- _I can't do it, yet._
- _I tried but it didn't work, yet._

> An experiment that observed hundreds of children who graduated to 7th grade over 2 years showed how the grades started to diverge in time although everybody started from a similar position; the only difference was their mindset.
