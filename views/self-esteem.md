# Self-esteem

There is a false belief that high self-esteem is the reason why a student gets good scores or why a person is successful in life. On the other hand, low self-esteem is considered to be the reason why a student gets bad scores and why a person may end up drog addicted.

Studies show that it's the other way around: having good scores increases your confidence level while being addicted lowers your self-esteem.
