# Willpower

Mental energy which, like a muscle, can become exhausted if it is overused but can also be strengthened through exercise.

## Characteristics:

1. It is finite in amount and becomes depleted as you use it.
2. It is shared between all activities (personal, professional, etc).

Thus, focus on one project at a time. You may succeed with more self-improving goals for a while by drawing your reserves, but you'll most probably fail when your willpower is depleted.

That's why New Year's Eve resolutions don't last. It' better to make only one resolution and stick with it.

It can be preserved (how a marathon runner conserves his energy for the last 100 yeard sprint).

### What is not

Willpower is not a skill that can be mastered.

## Consumers

- Decision making: performance control
- Self-control: emotion control, thought control, impulse control
- Coping with stress
- Coping with pain

### Powering the will

Willpower is fulled by the glucose in our bloodstream, which is converted into neurotransmitters.

Please note that glucose is important also for other parts of our body:

- brain
- muscles
- heart and liver
- immune system (when you're sick)
- reproductive system (at women)

### Tips

- **Feed the beast**: don't engage in important tasks (tests, important meetings, vital projects ) without glucose. For example, don't engage into an argument with your direct manager long after you had lunch, you may not have enough glucose to self-control.

- **Eat healthy**: eat as much as possible low glycemic index aliments (most vegetables, nuts like peanuts or cashews, raw fruits like apples, blueberries, cheese, fish, olive oil, and other good fats) instead of the high glycemic index ones (carbohydrates like white bread, potatoes, white race, snacks, fast-food, etc). High glycemic aliments create a boom-and-bust cycle leaving you short on glucose and self-control. There might be times when you may benefit of a sugary drink if you need a boost in your self-control for a short period of time, but is not a good strategy on the long-term.

- **When you're sick, save your glucose for the immune system**: When you're immune system fights a disease (like a cold) it uses as much glucose as possible, thus there is none left for your brain. Don't engage in activities that require willpower or self-control (and don't expected from others under the same conditions)

- **When you're tired, sleep**: Sleep reduces the body's demands for glucose and improves the ability to make use of it. Sleep deprivation impairs the processing of glucose, thus weakening self-control and decision making.
