# Will power

Mental energy which, like a muscle, can become exhausted if it is overused but can also be strengthened through exercise.

Characteristics:

1. It is finite in amount and becomes depleted as you use it.
2. It is shared between all activities (personal, professional, etc).

Thus, focus on one project at a time. You may succeed with more self-improving goals for a while by drawing your reserves, but you'll most probably fail when your will power is depleted.

That's why New Year's Eve resolutions don't last. It' better to make only one resolution and stick with it.

It can be preserved (how a marathon runner conserves his energy for the last 100 yeard sprint).

### Powering the will

Will power is fulled by the glucose in our bloodstream, which is converted into neurotransmitters.

Please note that glucose is important also for other parts of our body:

- brain
- muscles
- heart and liver
- immune system (when you're sick)
- reproductive system (at women)

Lessons learned:

- **Feed the beast**: don't engage in important tasks (tests, important meetings, vital projects ) without glucose. For example, don't engage into an argument with your direct manager long after you had lunch, you may not have enough glucose to self-control.

- **Eat healthy**: eat as much as possible low glycemic index aliments (most vegetables, nuts like peanuts or cashews, raw fruits like apples, blueberries, cheese, fish, olive oil, and other good fats) instead of the high glycemic index ones (carbohydrates like white bread, potatoes, white race, snacks, fast-food, etc). High glycemic aliments create a boom-and-bust cycle leaving you short on glucose and self-control. There might be times when you may benefit of a sugary drink if you need a boost in your self-control for a short period of time, but is not a good strategy on the long-term.

- **When you're sick, save your glucose for the immune system**: When you're immune system fights a disease (like a cold) it uses as much glucose as possible, thus there is none left for your brain. Don't engage in activities that require will power or self-control (and don't expected from others under the same conditions)

- **When you're tired, sleep**: Sleep reduces the body's demands for glucose and improves the ability to make use of it. Sleep deprivation impairs the processing of glucose, thus weakening self-control and decision making.

### Self-control

Self-control (or self-regulation) is the ability to regulate emotions, thoughts, and behavior in the face of temptation and impulses (short term) and act on long term goals. It consumes will power.

It is the trait of positive outcomes in life, but also the root cause of all personal and social problems.

The brain area that is responsible for self-control is called **anterior cingulate cortex**: it watches for conflicts in what you are doing and what you intended to do.

However, depleting will power shift the activity from one part of the brain to another, thus:

- the level of energy consumption remains the same
- this justifies why we have an increase in the intensity of our feelings (and craving for sweets)

Mastering self-control (aka discipline) enables you to conserve will power for more important challenges.

How to master self-control:

1. Set a goal
2. ...

_Ego depletion_: diminish the capacity to self-control by overexerting will power. Studies show that ego depletion can affect other social animals (like dogs).

Symptoms: Look for a change in the overall intensity of your feeling. Craving for sweets.

### What is not

Will power is not a skill that can be mastered.

## Will power consumers

- Decision making: performance control
- Self-control: emotion control, thought control, impulse control
- Coping with stress
- Coping with pain

### Emotion control

Trying to escape from bad moods or unpleasant thoughts. Sometimes to avoid cheeriness.

It is hard to control because you cannot alter your mood by an act of will.

I try to name the emotion to get it out of my mind. It usually works after I find the source of the emotion.

Also, trying to distract yourself with other thoughts or activities also helps.

### Thought control

Trying to ignore something serious or something annoying, like an earworm.

Meditation and focus help. I try to put my thoughts on the paper and this works for me most of the time.

Often, we seek a predetermined conclusion (like principles, values, common believes or just deceiving ourselves)

### Impulse control

Ability to resist temptation like alcohol, smoking, sweets, etc.

However, we cannot control impulses. We can only control how we react to them.

### Performance control

Focusing the energy on the task at hand: balanced between speed, accuracy. time management or persevering when you feel like quitting.
