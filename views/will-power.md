# Will power

Mental energy which, like a muscle, can became exhausted if it is overused but can also be strengthened through exercise.

It is fulled by glucose in our bloodstream. It can be preserved like a marathon runner conserves his energy for the last 100 yeard sprint.

Characteristics:

1. Is finite in amount and becomes depleted as you use it.
2. Is shared between all activities (personal, professional, etc).

Thus, focus on one project at a time. You may succeed with more self-improving goals for a while by drawing your reserves, but you'll most probably fail when your will power is depleted.

That's why New Year's Eve resolutions don't last. It' better to make only one resolution and stick with it.

Self-control (or self-regulation) is the ability to regulate emotions, thoughts, and behavior in the face of temptation and impulses (short term)and act on long term goals. It consumes will power.

It is the trait of positive outcomes in life, but also the root cause of all personal and social problems.

The brain area that is responsible for self-control is called **anterior cingulate cortex**: it watches for conflicts in what you are doing and what you intended to do.

Mastering self-control (aka discipline) enables you to conserve will power for more important challenges.

How to master self-control:

1. Set a goal
2. ...

_Ego depletion_: diminish the capacity to self-control by over exerting will power.

Symptoms: Look for a change in the overall intensity of your feeling.

## Will power consumers

- Decision making: performance control
- Self-control: emotion control, thought control, impulse control
- Coping with stress
- Coping with pain

### Emotion control

Trying to escape from bad moods or unpleasant thoughts. Sometimes to avoid cheeriness.

It is hard to control because you cannot alter your mood by an act of will.

I try to name the emotion to get it out of my mind. It usually works after I find the source of the emotion.

Also, trying to distract yourself with other thoughts or activities also helps.

### Thought control

Trying to ignore something serious or something annoying, like an earworm.

Meditation and focus help. I try to put my thoughts on the paper and this works for me most of the time.

Often, we seek a predetermined conclusion (like principles, values, common believes or just deceiving ourselves)

### Impulse control

Ability to resist temptation like alcohol, smoking, sweets, etc.

However, we cannot control impulses. We can only control how we react to them.

### Performance control

Focusing the energy on the task at hand: balanced between speed, accuracy. time management or persevering when you feel like quitting.
