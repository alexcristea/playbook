# Performance Review

[KPIs](views/kpi.md) and [OKRs](views/okr.ms) can and should be used for performance review. The way they should be used is by how someone is engaged and contributes to them:

- How did the work contribute to the KPIs/ KRs?
- How did they engage with the KPIs?

Full performance review system:

- the team members rate themselves
- the team leader rates the team members
- the two points of view are discussed
  - next steps and action items are identified
