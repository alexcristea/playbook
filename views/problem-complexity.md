# Problem Complexity

There are 3 kinds of problems in the world: simple, complicated and complex.

### Simple

Simple problems are the ones for which there is a recipe. They may require some skills to learn.

> For example baking a cake.

### Complicated

Complicated problems are the ones for which there is no straightforward recipe. They can be often broken down into more simple problems. They require multiple people/ teams working on them and may require some specialization. Unanticipated difficulties are frequent. They require timing and coordination.

However, once you solved a complicated problem you can repeat the process and improve it.

> For example building a rocket. Once you make one you can make another one.

### Complex

Complex problems are the ones for which the outcomes are uncertain when solving them. Although solving such a problem you gain experience, it doesn't guarantee success with the next one. Expertise is valuable but not sufficient.

> For example raising a child. Each child is different and they may require different approaches.
