# Wheel of Life

A tool that gives you a birds-eye view of the important areas of your life, to see where you most need improvement to achieve balance.

It helps you quickly and graphically identify the areas in your life to which you want to devote more energy, and helps you understand where you might want to cut back.

The challenge now is to transform this knowledge and desire for a more balanced life into a positive program of action.

## Process

1. Identify

- Identify six to eight dimensions of your life important for you.

2. Assess

- Rate the amount of attention you give to each area with a number from 0 to 10.
- Join up the marks.
- Does the wheel look balanced?

3. Ideal

- What should be the ideal level of attention to each area?

4. Act

- Where are the gaps? Gaps can go both ways.
- Create an action plan to fill in the gaps.
