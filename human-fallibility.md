# Human Fallibility

We fail at what we set out to do in the world for two reasons. The first is **ignorance** and the second is **ineptitude**.

### Ignorance

We fail because science has given us only a partial understanding of the world and how it works.

> There is the bridge that we don't know yet how to build it.

### Ineptitude

The knowledge about the world and how it works exists but we fail to apply it correctly, safely or reliably.

> There is the bridge that is built wrong and collapses.

## Discussion

In the last decades, the know-how and complexity have increased in all fields and industries and, as a result, we have real challenges delivering on them. These challenges are reflected in the common error that we frequently make.

There is also an emotional attachments to the ineptitude errors. In general, it is easier to forgive an error made because of knowledge lack than an error made because you did not apply the knowledge correctly (thus the synonym of *negligence* or *heartlessness*).

The main strategy to overcoming ineptitude failure is trough more experience and training. While experience and practice is important for ones mastery, this strategy works when the reason of failure is the individual skill itself.

The volume and complexity of what we know has exceeded or individual ability to deliver it benefits correctly, safely or reliably. Knowledge has both saved us and burdened us.

Another strategy to overcoming failure, one that builds on experience and knowledge, and also makes up for the human ineptitude is the **checklist**.
