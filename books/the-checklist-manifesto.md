# The Checklist Manifesto

The author makes the case that, in this age where we have a huge volume of know-how (we have specializations and superspecializations) and where we depend on systems (of people, machines, or both that we have to make them work together) we are more than ever prone to ineptitude errors.

One reason is that our fields have become too complex to rely only on our flawed memory and reduced attention. Another is that we are not beings of discipline and we tend to skip steps, even the important ones.

Most professions try to handle this with more training. While training and practice is important for one to achieve mastery, it will not protect her against the ineptitude errors.

He proposes to give a try to the checklist, the easiest and simpler tool to protect us against such errors.

However, although the checklist proved their worth (look for successful applications in aviation, medicine, construction or finance) there is still resistance from experts to adopt it.

> The final results showed that the rate of major complications for surgical patients in all 8 hospitals fell by 36% after the introduction of the checklist. Deaths fell 47%.
