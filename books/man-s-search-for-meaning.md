# Man's Search for Meaning

My main take away is that I should not look for a single ultimate purpose in my life. But rather I should change my perspectives and look for meaning in everything I do, every day and every hour.

>
> ...

## Quotes

> "He who has a Why to live for can bear almost any How."
>
> — Nietzsche

> Life is not primarily a quest for pleasure, as Freud believed, or a quest for power, as Alfred Adler taught, but a quest for meaning.
>
> — [Man's Search for Meaning][1] by [Viktor Frankl][2]

> Forces beyond your control can take away everything you possess except one thing, your freedom to choose how you will respond to the situation. You cannot control what happens to you in life, but you can always control what you will feel and do about what happens to you.
>
> — [Man's Search for Meaning][1] by [Viktor Frankl][2]

> Thus, when we saw a comrade smoking his own cigarettes, we knew he had given up faith in his strength to carry on, and, once lost, the will to live seldom returned.
>
> — [Man's Search for Meaning][1] by [Viktor Frankl][2]

> We knew that we had nothing to lose except our so ridiculously naked lives.
>
> — [Man's Search for Meaning][1] by [Viktor Frankl][2]

> The medical men among us learned first of all: “Textbooks tell lies!” Somewhere it is said that man cannot exist without sleep for more than a stated number of hours. Quite wrong!
>
> — [Man's Search for Meaning][1] by [Viktor Frankl][2]

> Yes, a man can get used to anything, but do not ask us how.
>
> — [Man's Search for Meaning][1] by [Viktor Frankl][2]

> At that moment I became intensely conscious of the fact that no dream, no matter how horrible, could be as bad as the reality of the camp which surrounded us.
>
> — [Man's Search for Meaning][1] by [Viktor Frankl][2]

> When the last layers of subcutaneous fat had vanished, and we looked like skeletons disguised with skin and rags, we could watch our bodies beginning to devour themselves.
>
> — [Man's Search for Meaning][1] by [Viktor Frankl][2]

> When, during our daily search for lice, we saw our own naked bodies in the evening, we thought alike: This body here, my body, is really a corpse already. What has become of me?
>
> — [Man's Search for Meaning][1] by [Viktor Frankl][2]

> One morning I heard someone, whom I knew to be brave and dignified, cry like a child because he finally had to go to the snowy marching grounds in his bare feet, as his shoes were too shrunken for him to wear.
>
> — [Man's Search for Meaning][1] by [Viktor Frankl][2]

> The truth—that love is the ultimate and the highest goal to which man can aspire.
>
> — [Man's Search for Meaning][1] by [Viktor Frankl][2]

> Love goes very far beyond the physical person of the beloved. It finds its deepest meaning in his spiritual being, his inner self. Whether or not he is actually present, whether or not he is still alive at all, ceases somehow to be of importance.
>
> — [Man's Search for Meaning][1] by [Viktor Frankl][2]

> To draw an analogy: a man’s suffering is similar to the behavior of gas. If a certain quantity of gas is pumped into an empty chamber, it will fill the chamber completely and evenly, no matter how big the chamber. Thus suffering completely fills the human soul and conscious mind, no matter whether the suffering is great or little. Therefore the “size” of human suffering is absolutely relative.
>
> — [Man's Search for Meaning][1] by [Viktor Frankl][2]

> No man should judge unless he asks himself in absolute honesty whether in a similar situation he might not have done the same.
>
> — [Man's Search for Meaning][1] by [Viktor Frankl][2]

> The list was the only thing that mattered. A man counted only because he had a prison number. One literally became a number: dead or alive—that was unimportant; the life of a “number” was completely irrelevant. What stood behind that number and that life mattered even less: the fate, the history, the name of the man.
>
> — [Man's Search for Meaning][1] by [Viktor Frankl][2]

> I generally answered all kinds of questions truthfully. But I was silent about anything that was not expressly asked for.
>
> — [Man's Search for Meaning][1] by [Viktor Frankl][2]

> Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.
>
> — [Man's Search for Meaning][1] by [Viktor Frankl][2]

> If there is a meaning in life at all, then there must be a meaning in suffering. Suffering is an ineradicable part of life, even as fate and death. Without suffering and death human life cannot be complete.
>
> — [Man's Search for Meaning][1] by [Viktor Frankl][2]

> Life is like being at the dentist. You always think that the worst is still to come, and yet it is over already.
>
> — [Man's Search for Meaning][1] by [Viktor Frankl][2]

> Emotion, which is suffering, ceases to be suffering as soon as we form a clear and precise picture of it.
> — Spinoza

> Life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual.
>
> — [Man's Search for Meaning][1] by [Viktor Frankl][2]

> When a man finds that it is his destiny to suffer, he will have to accept his suffering as his task; his single and unique task. He will have to acknowledge the fact that even in suffering he is unique and alone in the universe. No one can relieve him of his suffering or suffer in his place. His unique opportunity lies in the way in which he bears his burden.

> But there was no need to be ashamed of tears, for tears bore witness that a man had the greatest of courage, the courage to suffer.

> We were not hoping for happiness—it was not that which gave us courage and gave meaning to our suffering, our sacrifices and our dying. And yet we were not prepared for unhappiness.

> But for every one of the liberated prisoners, the day comes when, looking back on his camp experiences, he can no longer understand how he endured it all.

> Man, however, is able to live and even to die for the sake of his ideals and values!
>
> — [Man's Search for Meaning][1] by [Viktor Frankl][2]

> What man actually needs is not a tensionless state but rather the striving and struggling for a worthwhile goal, a freely chosen task.
>
> — [Man's Search for Meaning][1] by [Viktor Frankl][2]

> No instinct tells him what he has to do, and no tradition tells him what he ought to do; sometimes he does not even know what he wishes to do. Instead, he either wishes to do what other people do (conformism) or he does what other people wish him to do (totalitarianism).
>
> — [Man's Search for Meaning][1] by [Viktor Frankl][2]

> Ultimately, man should not ask what the meaning of his life is, but rather he must recognize that it is he who is asked. In a word, each man is questioned by life; and he can only answer to life by answering for his own life; to life he can only respond by being responsible.

> Pleasure is, and must remain, a side-effect or by-product, and is destroyed and spoiled to the degree to which it is made a goal in itself.
>
> — [Man's Search for Meaning][1] by [Viktor Frankl][2]

> Man does not simply exist but always decides what his existence will be, what he will become in the next moment.

> — [Man's Search for Meaning][1] by [Viktor Frankl][2]

> Freedom is but the negative aspect of the whole phenomenon whose positive aspect is responsibleness. That is why I recommend that the Statue of Liberty on the East Coast be supplemented by a Statue of Responsibility on the West Coast.

> A human being is not one thing among others; things determine each other, but man is ultimately self-determining.

> After all, man is that being who invented the gas chambers of Auschwitz; however, he is also that being who entered those gas chambers upright, with the Lord’s Prayer or the Shema Yisrael on his lips.

> Nihilism does not contend that there is nothing, but it states that everything is meaningless.
